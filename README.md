PDF3MD is a web application designed for efficient conversion of PDF documents into well-structured Markdown and Microsoft Word (DOCX) formats. It features a React-based frontend and a Python Flask backend, providing a seamless user experience with real-time progress updates.

## Core Features

-   **PDF to Markdown Conversion**: Transforms PDF documents into clean, readable Markdown, preserving structural elements.
-   **Markdown to Word (DOCX) Conversion**: Converts user-provided Markdown text to DOCX format using Pandoc for high-fidelity output.
-   **Multi-File Upload**: Supports uploading and processing multiple PDF files simultaneously for PDF to Markdown conversion.
-   **Drag & Drop Interface**: User-friendly file uploads via drag and drop or traditional file selection.
-   **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Detailed status updates during the conversion process for each file.
-   **File Information Display**: Shows original filename, file size, page count, and conversion timestamp.
-   **Modern and Responsive UI**: Intuitive interface designed for ease of use across various devices.

## Technology Stack

-   **Frontend**: React, Vite
-   **Backend**: Python, Flask
-   **PDF Processing**: PyMuPDF4LLM
-   **Markdown to DOCX Conversion**: Pandoc

## Getting Started

The easiest and recommended way to run PDF3MD is using the provided Docker quick start script.

### Prerequisites

-   Docker Engine
-   Docker Compose (typically included with Docker Desktop)
-   Git (for cloning the repository)

### Using the Quick Start Script (Recommended for Docker)

This script simplifies managing the Docker containers for both production and development environments.

1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/pdf3md.git
    cd pdf3md
    ```

2.  **Start in Production Mode**:
    ```bash
    ./docker-start.sh start
    ```
    -   Access Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
    -   Access Backend API: `http://localhost:6201`

3.  **Start in Development Mode** (with hot-reloading):
    ```bash
    ./docker-start.sh dev
    ```
    -   Access Frontend (Vite Dev Server): `http://localhost:5173`
    -   Access Backend API: `http://localhost:6201`

4.  **Other Useful Script Commands**:
    ```bash
    ./docker-start.sh stop      # Stop all services
    ./docker-start.sh status    # Check running services
    ./docker-start.sh logs      # View logs from services
    ./docker-start.sh help      # Display all available script commands
    ```
    Ensure the script is executable: `chmod +x ./docker-start.sh`

### Direct Docker Compose Usage (Alternative)

If you prefer to use Docker Compose commands directly:

#### Production Deployment

1.  **Clone the Repository** (if not already done):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/pdf3md.git
    cd pdf3md
    ```
2.  **Start Services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```
3.  **Access Application**: Frontend at `http://localhost:3000`, Backend API at `http://localhost:6201`.
4.  **Stop Services**:
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

#### Development Environment

1.  **Start Services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
    ```
2.  **Access Application**: Frontend (Vite) at `http://localhost:5173`, Backend API at `http://localhost:6201`.
3.  **Stop Services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
    ```

### Manual Setup

Alternatively, you can run the application components manually.

#### Backend (Flask)

1.  Navigate to the `pdf3md` sub-directory: `cd pdf3md`
2.  Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Start the backend server: `python app.py`
    (The backend will be available at `http://localhost:6201`)

#### Frontend (React)

1.  In a new terminal, navigate to the `pdf3md` sub-directory: `cd pdf3md`
2.  Install Node.js dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the frontend development server: `npm run dev`
    (The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`)

#### Convenience Scripts

The `pdf3md` sub-directory contains scripts for managing both services:
-   `./start_server.sh`: Starts both frontend and backend.
-   `./stop_server.sh`: Stops both services.
    (Ensure these scripts are executable: `chmod +x ./start_server.sh ./stop_server.sh`)

## Usage Instructions

1.  Open the PDF3MD application in your web browser.
2.  Upload one or more PDF files using the drag-and-drop area or by clicking to select files.
3.  Monitor the real-time progress as each PDF is converted.
4.  Once a file is processed, the resulting Markdown will be displayed.
5.  You can then:
    -   Copy the Markdown text (from PDF to MD conversion).
    -   In "MD â†’ Word" mode, input Markdown and download the content as a DOCX file (powered by Pandoc).

## Configuration Notes

-   **Backend Port**: The Flask server runs on port `6201` by default, configurable in `pdf3md/app.py`.
-   **Frontend API Proxy**: The Vite development server proxies API requests. If the backend port changes, update `pdf3md/vite.config.js`.
-   **Environment Variables (Docker)**:
    -   `FLASK_ENV`: `development` or `production`.
    -   `FLASK_DEBUG`: `1` for debug mode.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Port Conflicts**: Ensure ports `3000`, `5173` (for dev), and `6201` are not in use by other applications. Use `docker compose down` to stop existing PDF3MD containers.
-   **Script Permissions (Manual Setup)**: If `start_server.sh` or `stop_server.sh` fail, make them executable: `chmod +x pdf3md/start_server.sh pdf3md/stop_server.sh`.
-   **Docker Issues**: Ensure Docker is running. Try rebuilding images with `docker compose up --build`.
-   **API Connectivity**: Verify the backend is running and accessible. Check browser console for errors.
