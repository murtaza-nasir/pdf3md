This project is dual-licensed. See the [License](#license) section for details.

A modern, user-friendly web application that converts PDF documents to clean, formatted Markdown text. Built with React frontend and Python Flask backend, featuring real-time conversion progress tracking and a sleek interface.

- **Clean Markdown Output**: Get well-formatted Markdown that preserves document structure
- **File Information Display**: See file size, page count, and conversion timestamp
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful, responsive interface that works on all devices
- **Fast Processing**: Efficient conversion using PyMuPDF4LLM library

## üöÄ Quick Start with Docker (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose. This will set up both the frontend and backend automatically.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on your system
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually comes with Docker Desktop)

### Production Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/murtaza-nasir/pdf3md.git
   cd pdf3md
   ```

2. **Start the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

3. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   - Backend API: http://localhost:6201

4. **Stop the application**:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

### Development Setup

For development with hot-reloading and live code changes:

1. **Start in development mode**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   - Frontend (with hot-reload): http://localhost:5173
   - Backend API: http://localhost:6201

3. **Stop development environment**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the application without Docker, you can set it up manually.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+ with pip
- Node.js 16+ with npm
- (Optional) Conda environment

### Backend Setup

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pdf3md
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   
   The backend will be available at http://localhost:6201

### Frontend Setup

1. **In a new terminal, navigate to the frontend directory**:
   ```bash
   cd pdf3md
   ```

2. **Install Node.js dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173

### Using the Convenience Scripts

The project includes handy scripts for starting and stopping both services:

- **Start both frontend and backend**:
  ```bash
  cd pdf3md
  ./start_server.sh
  ```

- **Stop both services**:
  ```bash
  cd pdf3md
  ./stop_server.sh
  ```

## üìñ How to Use

1. **Open the application** in your web browser
2. **Upload a PDF** by either:
   - Dragging and dropping a PDF file onto the upload area
   - Clicking the upload area and selecting a file
3. **Watch the progress** as your PDF is converted
4. **Copy the result** - the Markdown text will appear in the output area
5. **Download or copy** the converted Markdown for use in your projects

## üîß Configuration

### Backend Configuration

The Flask backend runs on port 6201 by default. You can modify this in `app.py`:

```python
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=6201)
```

### Frontend Configuration

The React frontend is configured to proxy API requests to the backend. If you change the backend port, update the proxy configuration in `vite.config.js`.

### Environment Variables

For Docker deployments, you can customize the following environment variables:

- `FLASK_ENV`: Set to `development` or `production`
- `FLASK_DEBUG`: Set to `1` for debug mode
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED`: Set to `1` for immediate output

## üê≥ Docker Commands Reference

### Production Commands
```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down

# Rebuild services
docker-compose up -d --build

# Remove everything (containers, networks, volumes)
docker-compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Start in background
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d

# View logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml logs -f

# Stop development environment
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml down
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Port already in use**:
- Make sure no other services are running on ports 3000, 5173, or 6201
- Use `docker-compose down` to stop any running containers

**Permission denied on scripts**:
```bash
chmod +x pdf3md/start_server.sh
chmod +x pdf3md/stop_server.sh
```

**Docker build fails**:
- Make sure Docker is running
- Try rebuilding with: `docker-compose up --build`

**Frontend can't connect to backend**:
- Verify the backend is running on port 6201
- Check that CORS is properly configured in the Flask app

### Logs and Debugging

**View Docker logs**:
```bash
# All services
docker-compose logs -f

# Specific service
docker-compose logs -f backend
docker-compose logs -f frontend
```

**Manual setup logs**:
- Backend logs: Check `pdf3md/backend.log`
- Frontend logs: Check `pdf3md/frontend.log`
